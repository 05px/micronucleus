Before contributing, please keep in mind the following:

 - Have a look at License.txt
 - If you're going to write or change C or Ruby code, read Style Guide.txt
 - When writing commit messages, please prefix your message with one of these:
	   firmware:
	   upgrade:
	   commandline:
	   ruby:
	   tests:
	 This will help us all understand what your commit is primarily in relation
	 to when reading through the commit history hunting for specific changes.
 - Even if you aren't writing code, we prefer spaces to tabs.
